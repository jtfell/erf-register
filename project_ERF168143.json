  "Project Proponent": "D J & B K MAKIM PTY LTD",
  "Project Name": "Garrawilla",
  "Project ID": "ERF168143",
  "Method": "Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative - Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration using Measurement and Models) Methodology Determination 2021",
  "Method URL": "https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2021L01696",
  "Method Type": "Agriculture",
  "Project Description": "This project will use the most recent science and agricultural knowledge to build soil organic matter. Improved land management strategies will include the maintenance of ground cover at all times, increases in water efficiencies to maintain pastures and crops, increasing soil fertility and nutrient availability, the elimination or reduction of tillage, the addition of organic matter from waste streams and the restoration of the soil biological community. There will be very significant community and national co-benefits for water and air quality, soil erosion control, weed control and drought.",
